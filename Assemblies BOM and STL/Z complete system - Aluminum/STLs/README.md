# Beta testers notice:
If you are a beta tester, the first kits were made with a little mistake. M3 Holes/threads for the chain support were forgotten. We have worked on 2 solutions. 

## Solution #1: 
In the STL folder, you can find a drilling template for the bed support as shown bellow. You can either drill 3mm holes and use bolts + nuts. Or drill 2.5mm and tap with M3 and use M3 bolts on both side as per the manual.
Or, you can also use just a wire loom or a wire sleeve if you prefer.

## Solution #2: 
If you do not want to drill your bed support or don't have a drill, you can use this chain mount instead. It will use 2x15mm M3 bolts and nuts to clamp it on the bed support plate. It is a 2 part chain mount. You will need to print the chain mount option2 with the spacer.

We are deeply sorry for the inconvenience
